Market Basket Analysis((APRIORI ALGORITHM))
Abstract:
Market Basket Analysis is one of the key techniques used by large retailers to uncover associations between items. It works by looking for combinations of items that occur together frequently in transactions. To put it another way, it allows retailers to identify relationships between the items that people buy.
Association Rules are widely used to analyze retail basket or transaction data and are intended to identify strong rules discovered in transaction data using measures of interest, based on the concept of strong rules.
Problem Statement: 
The problem is to perform market basket analysis on grocery store data in order to identify associations and patterns among products frequently purchased together by customers.
